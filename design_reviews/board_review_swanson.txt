commit b1d935d5b287e0410df0b64effebc5e929b484d4

What are J4/J6, etc for?

routing on your oscillator should look more like the layout on the redboard

pours for radio driver need to extend under the balun and caps,

Your ground pours around the antenna driver aren't right.  They don't seem to be there at all.

What is J7?

Why the extra buttons?

you have alot of ground on your top metal layer.  not sure why you aren't connecting to the ground plane.

Motor control lines don't need to be high-current.

I would rename things with names U$12.  It's bad style.

IT looks like you have a pour connecting BAT_GND and GND.  It should just the be the net bridge.

The outline of your pours is sloppy! :-)
