Meeting Location: NVSL (CSE 2209)
Meeting Time: May 3rd, 7:00pm

No traces/vias should be under the IMU
The bounding box surrounding the design is larger than 30 in^2

Balun's connections to rfp and rfn are not the same length. 
The length of the traces connecting rfp/rfn to the balun should be shorttened a lot
The Faraday cage should not surround attenna - only the analog circuitry between it and the micro controller
The attenna circuit should be isolated from the power pours. A ground pour should surround it on layers 1-2
the trace between the balun and the antenna should be extra-thick

t-restrict/b-restrict/t-keepout/b-keepout seem to be largely unused

*-restrict will prevent the autorouter from entering the area defined by region drawn. 
^^^ This is useful to prevent the auto router from harming your attenna circuit

*-keepout will let DRC what things shouldn't touch. It's useful for enforcing when things should not overlap

The 3V and VBat pours should be isolated by empty space so they don't short
The BatGND pour and GND pour can be isolated similiarally - although they should converage at some choke point
The VBat pours should cover the motor pads
