MOTOR_GND should be BAT_GND

You seem to be missing the input cap on your voltage regulator.  It should be connected to BAT_GND.  The input side ground of the regulator sohuld also be BAT_GND.

You are missing the jumper between the positive battery terminal and BAT_GND.

The DTR line should not be connected to reset on the second serial port.

You can get rid of the pulldowns on your buttons by relying on the builtin pullup/pulldown resistors in the ucontroller.  I forget whether they are pull up or pull down.  Check the docs or talk to me.

You can connect AREF directly to 3V, and you should.  Otherwise, your bat sense will not work.

There's not much point in keeping the filter Resistor on the motor controller if you are going to  get rid of the filter cap.

you don't need the pullup resistors on the inputs to the IMU.  You can just hook them to 3V.

Missing SDA/SCL pullups?

you are missing the crystal.  You need that badly.  The redboard has two, you just need one.

Attributes are not set on your buttons.
